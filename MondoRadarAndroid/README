You need a GoogleMapsAPI-Key to use the mapping feature. You can request it for free here:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/maps-api-signup.html

After you got the key create the following File under /res/values and store your key as pointed out below.
======/res/values/mapapi.xml====
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="googlemapsapikey">1IS1kq22__EXAMPLE_KEY__7MOI12_+M8fJvhg</string>
</resources>
=====FILE END===================

Yey - You are ready to use it.
